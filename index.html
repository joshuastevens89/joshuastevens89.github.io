            <h2>Joshua Stevens</h2>


            <p>Joshua Stevens had always been captivated by computers. From a young age, he could remember the blinking
                cursor on an old Windows computer, the green letters and flashing code that sparked his imagination.
                Growing up in Princeton, Texas, his fascination only deepened over time. While his classmates might have
                been drawn to sports or music, Joshua was the kid dismantling the family computer to see how it all
                worked, then putting it back together just to prove he could. His mom, who raised him and his younger
                brother, Izaiah, on her own, saw his natural knack for technology early on. She encouraged him,
                supporting his curiosity even when it meant the occasional "tech support" phone call from friends and
                neighbors.</p>


            <p>Joshua's life has been a winding road of diverse experiences. He graduated from Princeton High School,
                known around town as the friendly, driven kid with a fascination for all things tech. After high school,
                he initially pursued a cosmetology degree, getting halfway through before life steered him in another
                direction. His hands-on skills and a natural affinity for connecting with people led him to work as a
                male dancer in clubs across Dallas, captivating crowds in LGBTQ spaces. This experience deepened his
                confidence and social savvy, allowing him to forge connections in ways he hadn’t imagined.</p>


            <p> After his time on the dance floors, Joshua redirected his energy into the construction industry. His
                entrepreneurial spirit shone through as he established two successful companies: Hammertime Contracting
                and The Remodelers. These ventures allowed him to channel his passion for building and problem-solving,
                adding structure and stability to his life. The skills and resilience he’d built along the way prepared
                him for leadership and the challenges of running his own businesses, blending hard work with creativity.
                But construction wasn’t his only pursuit. Joshua’s life took yet another turn when he started working in
                the restaurant industry, eventually taking on a managerial role at Waffle House. His confidence, charm,
                and easy-going nature made him a familiar face and a cherished friend to many. The work was tough, but
                Joshua thrived in environments where he could be social, connect with people, and make them feel
                comfortable.</p>


            <p>Through all of this, though, Joshua’s love for technology never faded. At 24, he attempted to jump into
                formal tech training, but life wasn’t ready to give him the green light just yet. Circumstances made it
                hard to commit fully to school, and he decided to wait until the timing was right. Now, in a stable
                environment with a steady job, Joshua has embraced the opportunity to return to his true calling.
                He's currently pursuing a full stack web development program at BloomTech Institute of Technology and an
                associate degree in software development at Dallas College, specializing in Java and Python. Learning to
                code and create web pages feels like coming home; he’s blending his childhood passion with new skills,
                mastering everything from backend logic to the design principles that make websites look sleek and
                polished. His innate curiosity and hands-on approach are exactly what make him excel in these fields.
                Joshua still holds dreams beyond his coursework. He has a few tech company ideas, complete with
                paperwork ready to go, but he’s taking his time, planning each move carefully to ensure that these
                ventures reflect his vision. He’s not just diving into the tech industry—he’s making a conscious,
                thoughtful entry, fortified by years of resilience, hard work, and life experience. Outside of tech,
                he’s passionate about health and nutrition. In his free time, you’ll often find him in the gym or
                researching the latest in supplementation, making sure his body has the nutrients it needs to keep up
                with his busy, demanding lifestyle.</p>


            <p>Today, Joshua Stevens is a man balancing a steady job, a rigorous academic schedule, and a thriving
                social life. He’s transformed his childhood fascination into a real-life pursuit, equipping himself with
                the skills to shape his own future in technology. His journey—from the boy who loved the flashing cursor
                to the manager, student, and entrepreneur—is one marked by determination, adaptability, and a love for
                learning that has carried him through every twist and turn.

            <h2>Zack Pearlman</h2>


            <p>Zack Pearlman’s journey into comedy and acting started in an unlikely place: Ann Arbor, Michigan. Born on
                May 19, 1988, Zack grew up in a supportive family that recognized his knack for humor early on. From
                making his classmates laugh in high school to honing his skills in improv and sketch comedy, Zack always
                had a natural ability to make people see the funny side of life.</p>


            <p> Zack attended Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, and though he was talented and funny, he didn’t have the
                typical path to Hollywood stardom. After high school, he briefly considered college, but his passion for
                acting and making people laugh was too strong. He threw himself into comedy, performing locally and
                online, knowing that the conventional route wasn’t for him. Zack’s big break came in an unconventional
                way: through a YouTube audition video. He entered a nationwide talent search for a role in the raunchy
                2010 comedy The Virginity Hit, produced by comedy giants Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. The movie, though
                not a blockbuster, made a mark, and Zack’s unique comedic presence and sense of timing caught the
                industry’s attention. It was the stepping stone he needed, proving that his instincts to jump straight
                into acting were spot-on.</p>


            <p>Zack soon found himself cast in The Inbetweeners, an American adaptation of the popular British series.
                Playing the role of Jay, Zack’s brand of humor—a mix of absurdity and sincerity—shone through, helping
                him gain a solid following. Although the show was short-lived, Zack’s performance left an impression,
                showcasing his adaptability and commitment to his craft.
                Afterward, he continued building his résumé with appearances in popular shows like Key & Peele,
                Workaholics, and Shameless. Each role, whether big or small, demonstrated his versatility and unique
                comedic flair. His next major role came in Mulaney, where he played "Big Deal." Though the series wasn’t
                a long-term hit, Zack’s portrayal of the quirky, lovable character was memorable, adding a layer of
                humor and warmth to the show.
                Perhaps one of his most notable achievements came with his role as Levon in Wet Hot American Summer:
                First Day of Camp and Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later, Netflix’s revival of the cult classic
                series. Zack’s character blended into the chaotic world of Camp Firewood perfectly, and he managed to
                stand out even in a cast filled with established comedy icons. These roles further cemented Zack as a
                dynamic actor capable of holding his own in an ensemble cast.</p>


            <p> Behind the scenes, Zack continued to work on his craft, branching into voice acting for animated shows
                and taking on diverse roles. He’s become known for his quick wit, comedic timing, and ability to bring a
                relatable warmth to every character he plays. Today, Zack Pearlman’s career reflects the journey of
                someone who pursued his dreams with resilience and humor. He’s a testament to the idea that there’s no
                single path to success in the entertainment industry, and his story shows how passion, determination,
                and a bit of humor can open doors that might otherwise remain closed.
                Zack Pearlman’s name is now recognized by audiences who appreciate his humor, his humility, and his
                ability to bring laughter to screens big and small.

            <h2>Web Development</h2>


            <p>From an early age, Joshua Stevens was entranced by the world of technology. Growing up in Princeton,
                Texas, he found himself spellbound by the flickering screen of an old Windows computer. The first time
                he saw that blinking cursor, it felt like magic. As a child, he would sit for hours, eyes glued to the
                screen, typing out commands and watching as a cascade of green text unfolded before him. Those early
                interactions with technology sparked a fire in him—a curiosity that would shape his future.
                As he navigated his school years, Joshua dove deeper into the world of computers. He was the kid who
                would take apart gadgets just to see how they worked, reassembling them with a newfound understanding.
                His bedroom was cluttered with computer parts, manuals, and wires—each component a puzzle waiting to be
                solved. Joshua loved building computers from scratch, troubleshooting them when they malfunctioned, and
                eventually mastering the art of programming. He soaked up every bit of knowledge he could find, pouring
                over books and online resources, teaching himself the intricacies of coding.</p>

                pushes the boundaries of what he can create.
                As he continues his studies, Joshua is also laying the groundwork for future endeavors. He has a few
                tech company ideas brewing in his mind, and he meticulously documented them, eager to develop the
                details. He
                envisions solutions that could simplify everyday tasks, enhance productivity, and even revolutionize
                industries. While he has the paperwork ready for these ventures, he knows the importance of thorough
                planning and execution.</p>


            <p>Joshua’s passion for technology extends beyond coding; he is also an advocate for health and wellness
                in the tech space. He understands the importance of balance, making sure he takes care of his physical
                and
                mental well-being while navigating the demanding world of software development. In the gym, he often
                finds inspiration for his projects, considering how technology could intersect with health, nutrition,
                and fitness.</p>


            <p> Today, Joshua Stevens stands at the precipice of his future in technology. Pursuing a solid education in
                software development and web programming, he will soon be ready to make his mark in the tech industry.
                His
                journey—rooted in a childhood fascination with computers and fueled by relentless curiosity—has equipped
                him with the skills to shape the digital world. Each line of code he writes is a step toward a future
                he’s eager to create, and the possibilities ahead are as endless as the blinking cursor that first
                ignited his passion so many years ago.
