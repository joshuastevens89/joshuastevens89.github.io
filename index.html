        <p class="section-text">
          Joshua Stevens had always been captivated by computers. From a young
          age, he could remember the blinking cursor on an old Windows computer,
          the green letters and flashing code that sparked his imagination.
          Growing up in Princeton, Texas, his fascination only deepened over
          time. While his classmates might have been drawn to sports or music,
          Joshua was the kid dismantling the family computer to see how it all
          worked, then putting it back together just to prove he could. His mom,
          who raised him and his younger brother, Izaiah, on her own, saw his
          natural knack for technology early on. She encouraged him, supporting
          his curiosity even when it meant the occasional "tech support" phone
          call from friends and neighbors.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Joshua's life has been a winding road of diverse experiences. He
          graduated from Princeton High School, known around town as the
          friendly, driven kid with a fascination for all things tech. After
          high school, he initially pursued a cosmetology degree, getting
          halfway through before life steered him in another direction. His
          hands-on skills and a natural affinity for connecting with people led
          him to work as a male dancer in clubs across Dallas, captivating
          crowds in LGBTQ spaces. This experience deepened his confidence and
          social savvy, allowing him to forge connections in ways he hadn’t
          imagined.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          After his time on the dance floors, Joshua redirected his energy into
          the construction industry. His entrepreneurial spirit shone through as
          he established two successful companies: Hammertime Contracting and
          The Remodelers. These ventures allowed him to channel his passion for
          building and problem-solving, adding structure and stability to his
          life. The skills and resilience he’d built along the way prepared him
          for leadership and the challenges of running his own businesses,
          blending hard work with creativity. But construction wasn’t his only
          pursuit. Joshua’s life took yet another turn when he started working
          in the restaurant industry, eventually taking on a managerial role at
          Waffle House. His confidence, charm, and easy-going nature made him a
          familiar face and a cherished friend to many. The work was tough, but
          Joshua thrived in environments where he could be social, connect with
          people, and make them feel comfortable.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Through all of this, though, Joshua’s love for technology never faded.
          At 24, he attempted to jump into formal tech training, but life wasn’t
          ready to give him the green light just yet. Circumstances made it hard
          to commit fully to school, and he decided to wait until the timing was
          right. Now, in a stable environment with a steady job, Joshua has
          embraced the opportunity to return to his true calling. He's currently
          pursuing a full stack web development program at BloomTech Institute
          of Technology and an associate degree in software development at
          Dallas College, specializing in Java and Python. Learning to code and
          create web pages feels like coming home; he’s blending his childhood
          passion with new skills, mastering everything from backend logic to
          the design principles that make websites look sleek and polished. His
          innate curiosity and hands-on approach are exactly what make him excel
          in these fields. Joshua still holds dreams beyond his coursework. He
          has a few tech company ideas, complete with paperwork ready to go, but
          he’s taking his time, planning each move carefully to ensure that
          these ventures reflect his vision. He’s not just diving into the tech
          industry—he’s making a conscious, thoughtful entry, fortified by years
          of resilience, hard work, and life experience. Outside of tech, he’s
          passionate about health and nutrition. In his free time, you’ll often
          find him in the gym or researching the latest in supplementation,
          making sure his body has the nutrients it needs to keep up with his
          busy, demanding lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Today, Joshua Stevens is a man balancing a steady job, a rigorous
          academic schedule, and a thriving social life. He’s transformed his
          childhood fascination into a real-life pursuit, equipping himself with
          the skills to shape his own future in technology. His journey—from the
          boy who loved the flashing cursor to the manager, student, and
          entrepreneur—is one marked by determination, adaptability, and a love
          for learning that has carried him through every twist and turn.

                making people laugh as well as bringing exceptional acting
                performances to audiences across the globe.
              </p>

        </article>

        

        <p class="section-text">
          Zack Pearlman’s journey into comedy and acting started in an unlikely
          place: Ann Arbor, Michigan. Born on May 19, 1988, Zack grew up in a
          supportive family that recognized his knack for humor early on. From
          making his classmates laugh in high school to honing his skills in
          improv and sketch comedy, Zack always had a natural ability to make
          people see the funny side of life.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Zack attended Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, and though he was
          talented and funny, he didn’t have the typical path to Hollywood
          stardom. After high school, he briefly considered college, but his
          passion for acting and making people laugh was too strong. He threw
          himself into comedy, performing locally and online, knowing that the
          conventional route wasn’t for him. Zack’s big break came in an
          unconventional way: through a YouTube audition video. He entered a
          nationwide talent search for a role in the raunchy 2010 comedy The
          Virginity Hit, produced by comedy giants Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.
          The movie, though not a blockbuster, made a mark, and Zack’s unique
          comedic presence and sense of timing caught the industry’s attention.
          It was the stepping stone he needed, proving that his instincts to
          jump straight into acting were spot-on.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Zack soon found himself cast in The Inbetweeners, an American
          adaptation of the popular British series. Playing the role of Jay,
          Zack’s brand of humor—a mix of absurdity and sincerity—shone through,
          helping him gain a solid following. Although the show was short-lived,
          Zack’s performance left an impression, showcasing his adaptability and
          commitment to his craft. Afterward, he continued building his résumé
          with appearances in popular shows like Key & Peele, Workaholics, and
          Shameless. Each role, whether big or small, demonstrated his
          versatility and unique comedic flair. His next major role came in
          Mulaney, where he played "Big Deal." Though the series wasn’t a
          long-term hit, Zack’s portrayal of the quirky, lovable character was
          memorable, adding a layer of humor and warmth to the show. Perhaps one
          of his most notable achievements came with his role as Levon in Wet
          Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp and Wet Hot American Summer:
          Ten Years Later, Netflix’s revival of the cult classic series. Zack’s
          character blended into the chaotic world of Camp Firewood perfectly,
          and he managed to stand out even in a cast filled with established
          comedy icons. These roles further cemented Zack as a dynamic actor
          capable of holding his own in an ensemble cast.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Behind the scenes, Zack continued to work on his craft, branching into
          voice acting for animated shows and taking on diverse roles. He’s
          become known for his quick wit, comedic timing, and ability to bring a
          relatable warmth to every character he plays. Today, Zack Pearlman’s
          career reflects the journey of someone who pursued his dreams with
          resilience and humor. He’s a testament to the idea that there’s no
          single path to success in the entertainment industry, and his story
          shows how passion, determination, and a bit of humor can open doors
          that might otherwise remain closed. Zack Pearlman’s name is now
          recognized by audiences who appreciate his humor, his humility, and
          his ability to bring laughter to screens big and small.

        </article>

        

        <p class="section-text">
          From an early age, Joshua Stevens was entranced by the world of
          technology. Growing up in Princeton, Texas, he found himself
          spellbound by the flickering screen of an old Windows computer. The
          first time he saw that blinking cursor, it felt like magic. As a
          child, he would sit for hours, eyes glued to the screen, typing out
          commands and watching as a cascade of green text unfolded before him.
          Those early interactions with technology sparked a fire in him—a
          curiosity that would shape his future. As he navigated his school
          years, Joshua dove deeper into the world of computers. He was the kid
          who would take apart gadgets just to see how they worked, reassembling
          them with a newfound understanding. His bedroom was cluttered with
          computer parts, manuals, and wires—each component a puzzle waiting to
          be solved. Joshua loved building computers from scratch,
          troubleshooting them when they malfunctioned, and eventually mastering
          the art of programming. He soaked up every bit of knowledge he could
          find, pouring over books and online resources, teaching himself the
          intricacies of coding.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          After high school, he initially ventured into cosmetology but soon
          realized that his passion lay elsewhere. At 24, Joshua decided to
          pursue a career in technology, enrolling in classes that would set the
          foundation for his journey in software development. His love for
          coding blossomed as he immersed himself in the world of programming
          languages, algorithms, and data structures. Joshua discovered a
          particular fascination with Java and Python, admiring their
          versatility and application in real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          To further his education, he enrolled at Dallas College, where he is
          pursuing an associates degree in software development. The experience
          is invigorating; he finds himself surrounded by like-minded
          individuals who share his enthusiasm for technology. The late-night
          study sessions, collaborative projects, and countless cups of coffee
          fuel his desire to learn. Each completed project brings a sense of
          accomplishment, from creating simple applications to developing more
          complex systems. Simultaneously, Joshua seeks out additional knowledge
          at BloomTech Institute of Technology, where he is tackling full stack
          web development. The combination of front-end design and back-end
          functionality fascinates him, and he embraces the challenge of
          mastering both sides. He loves crafting user-friendly interfaces while
          ensuring robust server-side logic, finding joy in bringing his ideas
          to life. The thrill of seeing a website he is coding come together,
          functioning seamlessly, ignites a sense of pride and fulfillment
          within him.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Throughout this journey, Joshua never lost sight of his childhood
          curiosity. He frequently experiments with personal projects, building
          websites and applications that showcased his growing skill set. His
          home office has become a hub of creativity, filled with sketches of
          ideas and code snippets, as he pushes the boundaries of what he can
          create. As he continues his studies, Joshua is also laying the
          groundwork for future endeavors. He has a few tech company ideas
          brewing in his mind, and he meticulously documented them, eager to
          develop the details. He envisions solutions that could simplify
          everyday tasks, enhance productivity, and even revolutionize
          industries. While he has the paperwork ready for these ventures, he
          knows the importance of thorough planning and execution.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Joshua’s passion for technology extends beyond coding; he is also an
          advocate for health and wellness in the tech space. He understands the
          importance of balance, making sure he takes care of his physical and
          mental well-being while navigating the demanding world of software
          development. In the gym, he often finds inspiration for his projects,
          considering how technology could intersect with health, nutrition, and
          fitness.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
          Today, Joshua Stevens stands at the precipice of his future in
          technology. Pursuing a solid education in software development and web
          programming, he will soon be ready to make his mark in the tech
          industry. His journey—rooted in a childhood fascination with computers
          and fueled by relentless curiosity—has equipped him with the skills to
          shape the digital world. Each line of code he writes is a step toward
          a future he’s eager to create, and the possibilities ahead are as
          endless as the blinking cursor that first ignited his passion so many
          years ago.
